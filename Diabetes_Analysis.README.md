ABSTRACT

Diabetes is among the most prevalent chronic diseases in the world, impacting over 10% of the world's adult population. Diabetes is a serious chronic disease in which individuals lose the ability to effectively regulate levels of glucose in the blood, leading to various health complications, including disorders of the cardiovascular system, eye, kidney, and nerves. Untreated or poorly treated diabetes accounts for approximately 1.5 million deaths every year. In our project we measure the risk of diabetes from socio-economic, behavioral and health related factors. We also quantify the increased risk of heart attack and stroke for people with diabetes.


THE DATASET

The Dataset is a clean dataset of 236,378 survey responses to the CDC's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2021. The target variable Diabetes_012 has 3 classes. 0 is for no diabetes or only during pregnancy, 1 is for prediabetes, and 2 is for diabetes. This dataset has 21 feature variables, some of which are factors that might increase the risk of Diabetes and others are adverse health impacts that might occur with Diabetes


ABOUT THE ANALYSIS
The Analysis is presented in four pages:

Overview:
The first page comprises of general overview of the dataset and key results from the following pages.

Socio Economic Factors Influencing Diabetes:
The 2nd page measures the correlation between socio-economic factors like income, age, education level and sex to risk of Diabetes

Other Contributing Factors:
This page measures correlation of diabetes to other factors, bot.h behavioral and health related like bmi, blood pressure, smoking, drinking etc.

Health Risks
The fourth page explores the health risks associated with Diabetes. We measure the increased risk of heart disease, stroke and impact on physical health for diabetics.


Steps Taken

1. Cleaning the dataset

2. Normalizing the Diabetes column to 0 for No Diabetes, 0.5 for Pre Diabetes and 1 for Diabetes. Considering someone with Pre Diabetes as a 50% risk of becoming Diabetic, this allows us to measure the correlation of becoming Diabetic to various factors.

3. Created Measures to calculate increased risk of Diabetes by each contributing factor.

4. Created Measures to calculate increased health risk faced by Diabetics

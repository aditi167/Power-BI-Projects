ABSTRACT

Customer Personality Analysis is a detailed analysis of a company’s ideal customers. It helps a business to better understand its customers and makes it easier for them to modify products according to the specific needs, behaviors and concerns of different types of customers.
Customer personality analysis helps a business to modify its product based on its target customers from different types of customer segments. For example, instead of spending money to market a new product to every customer in the company’s database, a company can analyze which customer segment is most likely to buy the product and then market the product only on that particular segment.


THE DATASET

The Dataset is a summary of customer purchases across products, promotional campaigns and sales channels.


ABOUT THE ANALYSIS
The Analysis is presented in 3 parts:

Customer Profile:
The 1st page groups customer spending habits across various metrics to build a profile of what the median customer looks like

Sales Channel:
The 2nd page shows the sales split across store, web and catalog purchases and analyses how the split varies by different customer groups.

Promotion:
The 3rd page shows the success rates of various promotional campaigns and also shows which customer groups are more likely to respond during promotions.

Steps Taken

1. Cleaning the dataset

2. Segregating Income, Age & Birth Year Columns into Groups

3. Splitting the data into fact table known as Fact_sales and three dimension tables namely Dim_Customer, Dim_Promotion, Dim_Place

4. Creating Measures to calculate Total, Relative & Average Percentage Changes
